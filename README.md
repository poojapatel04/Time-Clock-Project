Project Overview
This Time Clock program was developed as part of the CS310 Software Engineering course under Professor Snellen at Jacksonville State University. The project simulates a workplace timeclock system, enabling functionalities like employee badge-based clock-ins, time accrual calculations, and shift management (including breaks).

The project also highlights the use of Scrum methodology and Agile principles through iterative development cycles (two-week sprints) and an evolving product backlog.


Key Features

Shift and Break Management: Accounts for shift durations, breaks, and accurate work hour logging.
SQL Database Integration:
Stores and manages employee records.
Ensures secure and efficient retrieval of time records.
Agile Development Process:
Developed in sprints with continuous feature enhancement.
New requirements were dynamically added to the product backlog.
